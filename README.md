# Laminar-Boundary-Layer
Thermal and Hydrodynamic Laminar Boundary Layer Solution, Completed in February 2024.

This project involves solving the Blasius and Polhausen equations to analyze laminar boundary layers over flat plates. The solutions are implemented in MATLAB, and the results include velocity profiles, streamlines, and heat lines.

Overview:
     The project focuses on:

     * Blasius Equation: A classic solution for the laminar boundary layer flow over a flat plate.
     * Polhausen Equation: A method for analyzing heat transfer in laminar boundary layers.

     Key objectives:
     * Solve the Blasius and Polhausen equations numerically.
     * Plot the velocity profiles, streamlines, and heat lines to visualize the flow characteristics.

Features:
Numerical solutions for both Blasius and Polhausen equations.
Visualization of the results, including:
Velocity profiles across the boundary layer.
Streamlines illustrating flow patterns.
Heat lines showing temperature distribution.

Contents:
Code/: MATLAB .m files for solving the Blasius and Polhausen equations.
Results/: Plots of velocity profiles, streamlines, and heat lines.

How to Run:
Download the MATLAB code files from the Code/ folder.
Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the files.
Run the main script (boundary_layer_analysis.m) to compute the solutions for both equations.
The resulting plots for velocity profiles, streamlines, and heat lines will be displayed.

Visualization:
The code generates:
Velocity Profiles: Shows the variation of fluid velocity across the boundary layer.
Streamlines: Visualizes the flow direction and pattern.
Heat Lines: Illustrates temperature distribution in the boundary layer.
